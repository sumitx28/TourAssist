# TourAssist: Streamlining Travel Experiences

TourAssist is a web application designed to empower tour agents to enhance their tour packages and enable customers to compare and personalize these packages according to their preferences.

# Project Overview

TourAssist aims to create a marketplace that provides a fair and even platform for all travel companies, regardless of their size, to offer travel and holiday packages to customers. The platform offers several key features to enhance the customer experience and streamline the process for travel agencies.

## Key Features

1. **Fair Platform:** TourAssist provides a fair platform for both big and small companies offering travel/holiday packages. It ensures equal visibility and opportunities for all companies to reach potential customers.

2. **Customizable Packages:** Travel agencies can provide customers with the option to customize their packages according to their preferences. For instance, if a customer wants to travel to a destination independently but prefers to include only hotel stay and activities in their package, they can customize the package accordingly. The price adjusts dynamically based on the selected customizations.

3. **Comparison View:** TourAssist offers an adjacent comparison view of two or more packages, allowing customers to easily compare what each package offers. This feature helps customers make informed decisions based on their preferences and requirements.

By offering these features, TourAssist aims to revolutionize the way travel agencies interact with customers and provide a seamless and personalized booking experience.
